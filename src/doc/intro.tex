\tbas\ is a BASIC dialect and its interpreter. \tbas\ emulates most of the common BASIC syntax while also adding more advanced and up-to-date concepts gracefully, such as a user-defined function that can \emph{actually} recurse, arbitrary list construction using CONS-operator and some of the features in the realm of functional programming from Map and Fold to Closure and Currying.

This is the documentation for \tbas\ \tbasver.
