We'll begin at the beginning; how beginning? This:

\begin{lstlisting}
10 PRINT 2+2
run
4
Ok
\end{lstlisting}

Oh \emph{boy} we just did a computation! It printed out \code{4} which is a correct answer for $2+2$ and it didn't crash!

\section[GOTO]{GOTO here and there}

\index{GOTO (tutorial)}
\code{GOTO} is used a lot in BASIC, and so does in \tbas. \code{GOTO} is a simplest method of diverging a program flow: execute only the part of the program conditionally and perform a loop.

Following program attempts to calculate a square root of the input value,  showing how \code{GOTO} can be used in such manner.

\begin{lstlisting}
10 X=1337
20 Y=0.5*X
30 Z=Y
40 Y=Y-((Y^2)-X)/(2*Y)
50 IF NOT(Z==Y) THEN GOTO 30 : REM 'NOT(Z==Y)' can be rewritten to 'Z<>Y' 
100 PRINT "Square root of ";X;" is approximately ";Y
\end{lstlisting}

Here, \code{GOTO} in line 50 is used to perform a loop, which keeps looping until \code{Z} and \code{Y} becomes equal. This is a newtonian method of approximating a square root. 

\section[Subroutine with GOSUB]{What If We Wanted to Go Back?}

\index{GOSUB (tutorial)}
But \code{GOTO} only jumps, you can't jump \emph{back}. Well, not with that attitute; you \emph{can} go back with \code{GOSUB} and \code{RETURN} statement.

This program will draw a triangle, where the actual drawing part is on line 100--160, and only get jumped into it when needed.

\begin{lstlisting}
10 GOTO 1000
100 REM subroutine to draw a segment. Size is stored to 'Q'
110 PRINT SPC(20-Q);
120 Q1=1 : REM loop counter for this subroutine
130 PRINT "*";
140 Q1=Q1+1
150 IF Q1<=Q*2-1 THEN GOTO 130
160 PRINT : RETURN : REM this line will take us back from the jump
1000 Q=1 : REM this is our loop counter
1010 GOSUB 100
1020 Q=Q+1
1030 IF Q<=20 THEN GOTO 1010
\end{lstlisting}

\section[FOR--NEXT Loop]{FOR ever loop NEXT}

\index{FOR--NEXT (tutorial)}
As we've just seen, you can make loops using \code{GOTO}s here and there, but they \emph{totally suck}, too much spaghetti crashes your cerebral cortex faster than \emph{Crash Bandicoot 2}. Fortunately, there's a better way to go about that: the FOR--NEXT loop!

\begin{lstlisting}
10 GOTO 1000
100 REM subroutine to draw a segment. Size is stored to 'Q'
110 PRINT SPC(20-Q);
120 FOR Q1=1 TO Q*2-1
130 PRINT "*";
140 NEXT : PRINT
150 RETURN
1000 FOR Q=1 TO 20
1010 GOSUB 100
1020 NEXT
\end{lstlisting}

When executed, this program print out \emph{exactly the same} triangle, but code is much more straightforward thanks to the \code{FOR} statement.

\section[Get User INPUT]{Isn't It Nice To Have a Computer That Will Question You?}

What fun is the program if it won't talk with you? You can make that happen with \code{INPUT} statement.

\begin{lstlisting}
10 PRINT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME";
20 INPUT NAME
30 PRINT "HELLO, ";NAME
\end{lstlisting}

This short program will ask your name, and then it will greet you by the name you told to the computer.

\section[Function]{Function}

\index{function (tutorial)}
Consider the following code:

\begin{lstlisting}
10 DEFUN POW2(N)=2^N
20 DEFUN DCOS(N)=COS(PI*N/180)
30 FOR X=0 TO 8
40 PRINT X,POW2(X)
50 NEXT
60 PRINT "----------------"
70 FOREACH A=0!45!90!135!180!NIL
80 PRINT A,DCOS(A)
90 NEXT
\end{lstlisting}

Here, we have defined two functions to use in the program: \code{POW2} and \code{DCOS}. Also observe that functions are defined using variable \code{N}s, but we use them with \code{X} in line 40 and with \code{A} in line 80: yes, functions can have their local name so you don't have to carefully choose which variable name to use in your subroutine.

Except a function can't have statements that spans two- or more BASIC lines; but there are ways to get around that, including \code{DO} statement and \emph{functional currying}\newcounter{curryingappearance}\setcounter{curryingappearance}{\value{page}}

This sample program also shows \code{FOREACH} statement, which is same as \code{FOR} but works with arrays.

\section[Recursion]{BRB: Bad Recursion BRB: Bad Recursion BRB: Bad Recursion BRB: Bad RecursionBRB: Bad Recursion BRBRangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded}

\index{recursion (tutorial)}
But don't get over-excited, as it's super-trivial to create unintentional infinite loop:

\begin{lstlisting}
10 DEFUN FAC(N)=N*FAC(N-1)
20 FOR K=1 TO 6
30 PRINT FAC(K)
40 NEXT
\end{lstlisting}

(if you tried this and computer becomes unresponsive, hit Ctrl-C to terminate the execution)

This failed attempt is to create a function that calculates a factorial of \code{N}. It didn't work because there is no \emph{halting condition}: didn't tell computer to when to escape from the loop.

$n \times 1$ is always $n$, and $0!$ is $1$, so it would be nice to break out of the loop when \code{N} reaches $0$; here is the modified program:

\begin{lstlisting}
10 DEFUN FAC(N)=IF N==0 THEN 1 ELSE N*FAC(N-1)
20 FOR K=1 TO 10
30 PRINT FAC(K)
40 NEXT
\end{lstlisting}

Since \code{IF-THEN-ELSE} can be chained to make third or more conditions --- \code{IF-THEN-ELSE IF-THEN} or something --- we can write a recursive Fibonacci function:

\begin{lstlisting}
10 DEFUN FIB(N)=IF N==0 THEN 0 ELSE IF N==1 THEN 1 ELSE FIB(N-1)+FIB(N-2)
20 FOR K=1 TO 10
30 PRINT FIB(K);" ";
40 NEXT
\end{lstlisting}

\section[Higher-order Function]{The Functions of the High Order}

\index{higher-order function (tutorial)}
Higher-order functions are functions that either takes another function as an argument, or returns a function. This sample program shows how higher-order functions can be constructed.

\begin{lstlisting}
10 DEFUN APPLY(F,X)=F(X)
20 DEFUN FUN(X)=X^2
30 K=APPLY(FUN,42)
40 PRINT K
\end{lstlisting}

Here, \code{APPLY} takes a function \code{F} and value \code{X}, \emph{applies} a function \code{F} onto the value \code{X} and returns the value. Since \code{APPLY} takes a function, it's higher-order function.

\section[MAPping]{Map}

\index{MAP (tutorial)}
\code{MAP} is a higher-order function that takes a function (called \emph{transformation}) and an array to construct a new array that contains old array transformed with given \emph{transformation}.

Or, think about the old \code{FAC} program before: it merely printed out the value of $1!$, $2!$ \ldots\ $10!$. What if we wanted to build an array that contains such values?

\begin{lstlisting}
10 DEFUN FAC(N)=IF N==0 THEN 1 ELSE N*FAC(N-1)
20 K=MAP(FAC, 1 TO 10)
30 PRINT K
\end{lstlisting}

Here, \code{K} holds the values of $1!$, $2!$ \ldots\ $10!$. Right now we're just printing out the array, but being an array, you can make actual use of it.

\section[Closure]{The Function with No Name}

\index{closure (tutorial)}
But \code{DEFUN F(X)} is only there for partial compatibility with traditional BASICs, of which their syntax is \code{DEF FNF(X)}. \code{DEFUN} cannot define nested functions, it's not a lambda-calculus system, yaddi yadda.

No, we want to be up-to-date; we don't always want every function to be global; we want to utter \emph{give me a closure, bar-tender}.

\tbas\ presents you: a closure. What does it do?

\begin{lstlisting}
10 FAC=[N]~>IF N==0 THEN 1 ELSE N*FAC(N-1)
20 K=MAP(FAC, 1 TO 10)
30 PRINT K
\end{lstlisting}

Here, \code{[N]\basicclosure\,\ldots} defines a \emph{closure} (anonymous function) that has single parameter \code{N}, then assigns it to global variable \code{FAC}.

But \emph{stop right there, criminal scum}: in what way is that an \emph{anonymous function}?

Ah-ha, take a look at this:

\begin{lstlisting}
10 F=[X]~>MAP([X]~>[X]<=5,X)
20 PRINT F(1 TO 10)
\end{lstlisting}

Here, \code{MAP} inside of the global function \code{F} has an internal function: \code{[X]\basicclosure[X]<=5}

This function is anonymous: only the \code{MAP} can use it and is not accessible from the other scopes. Even if the \code{F} and the anonymous function use same parameter name of \code{X}, they don't matter because two functions are different.


\section[Currying]{Haskell Curry Wants to Know Your Location}
\label{currying101}

\newcounter{curryingselfref}
\setcounter{curryingselfref}{\value{page} - \value{curryingappearance}}

\index{curry (tutorial)}
\cnttoenglish{\value{curryingselfref}}{page} ago there was a mentioning about something called \emph{functional currying}. So what the fsck is currying? Consider the following code:

\begin{lstlisting}
10 DEFUN F(K,T)=ABS(T)==K
20 CF=F~<32
30 PRINT CF(24) : REM will print 'false'
40 PRINT CF(-32) : REM will print 'true'
\end{lstlisting}

% NOTE: you can't use \basiccurry within \code{}
Here, \code{CF} is a curried function of \code{F}; built-in operator \code{\basiccurry} applies \code{32} to the first parameter of the function \code{F}, which dynamically returns a \emph{function} of \code{CF(T) = ABS(T) == 32}. The fact that Curry Operator returns a \emph{function} opens many possibilities, for example, you can create loads of sibling functions without making loads of duplicate codes.

But, what if we pre-cook the curry before serve? The \code{\basiccurry} operator is there to curry an un-curried function; we rarely need that if the function was curried in the begin with.

Here, \emph{closure} do wonders as well; for a fun of it, let's re-write the \code{F(K,T)} to be pre-curried:

\begin{lstlisting}
10 F=[K]~>[T]~>ABS(T)==K
20 CF=F(32)
30 PRINT CF(24) : REM will print 'false'
40 PRINT CF(-32) : REM will print 'true'
\end{lstlisting}

The function \code{F}, when called, returns its inner function \code{[T]\basicclosure ABS(T)==K} with \code{K} being substituted with the argument that were applied to \code{F}, so the function \code{CF} here can be expressed as: \code{[T]\basicclosure(T)==32}

The subsequent calls for \code{CF} returns appropriate values, in the same manner as the descriptions above.

\section[Wrapping-Up]{The Grand Unification}

Using all the knowledge we have learned, it should be trivial\footnote{/s} to write a Quicksort function in \tbas, like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
10 DEFUN LESS(P,X)=X<P
11 DEFUN GTEQ(P,X)=X>=P
12 DEFUN QSORT(XS)=IF LEN(XS)<1 THEN NIL ELSE 
    QSORT(FILTER(LESS~<HEAD(XS),TAIL(XS))) # HEAD(XS)!NIL # 
    QSORT(FILTER(GTEQ~<HEAD(XS),TAIL(XS)))
100 L=7!9!4!5!2!3!1!8!6!NIL
110 PRINT L
120 PRINT QSORT(L)
\end{lstlisting}

Line 12 implements quicksort algorithm, using \code{LESS} and \code{GTEQ} as helper functions. \code{LESS} is a user-function version of less-than operator, and \code{GTEQ} is similar. \code{QSORT} selects a pivot by taking the head-element of the array \code{XS}\footnote{Stands for \emph{X's}.} with \code{HEAD(XS)}, then utilises curried version of \code{LESS} and \code{GTEQ} to move lesser-than-pivot values to the left and greater to the right (the head element itself does not get recursed, here \code{TAIL(XS)} is applied to make head-less copy of the array), and these two separated \emph{chunks} are recursively sorted using the same \code{QSORT} function. Currying is exploited to give comparison functions a pivot-value to compare against, and also because \code{FILTER} wants a \emph{function} and not an \emph{expression}. \code{HEAD(XS)!NIL} creates a single-element array contains head-element of the \code{XS}.

Using the closure, the definition of \code{QSORT} no longer need helper functions, can truly be a one-liner and be \emph{even more cryptic}:

\begin{lstlisting}
10 QSORT=[XS]~>IF LEN(XS)<1 THEN NIL ELSE 
    QSORT(FILTER([X]~>X<HEAD XS,TAIL XS)) # HEAD(XS)!NIL # 
    QSORT(FILTER([X]~>X>=HEAD XS,TAIL XS))
\end{lstlisting}

Compare with the lengthy version and this one, and try to tell how it works; this is the today's excercise.
